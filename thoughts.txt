articulate five answer-gods:
- MUCUS: embodiment at all costs, vomit is sacred because it's embodied, etc
- GOD: light of the true thing, contemplation to the exclusion of action
- CIGARRETTES: towards intensity, exemplified by drug use
- DELUSION: materialist certainty, floating monuments of logic, scientism
- SHARK: assert a new covenent, 'fine, then i'll be the villain'


five characters, each starts with zero in all but one score. (plus another - natalia the innocent - who starts at all zero)
bullet dodging gameplay to fight suffering. equip items such as weapons and shields that affect the five stats. most are automatic, a few require activation.
game is fairly short, with different endings depending on your top stat at the end, plus bonus endings for having all equal and one for when none of those conditions are met (ie. some but not all are equal).
these endings are brief VN segments with more than one sort of sub-ending each



enemies:
- perceiver: a floating eye
- speaker: a floating mouth
- albatross: clues in the name
- insectoid: a crab
- restrainer: a latex-gloved hand that flies at you
- light-leech: a dead flower that shoots in all directions
- teeth of the void: spiky things that shoot and divebomb
- eyecatcher: mirrored something that shoots to whichever side of the you're on (and typically is on an up and down path)
bosses:
- the solipsist: surrounded by a slowly but endlessly refilling circle of orbiting restrainers, you'll have to shoot a hole in the circle, get or shoot through to do some damage, but at points it blasts everything inside the circle
- the sovereign: an infection that spreads through the endless waves of enemies, you'll have to kill all instances of it to stop it spreading
- the first mistake: classic multi-stage big boss, area denial stuff. first stage has a prominent closed mouth that opens to reveal an eyeball

equipment:
- vomit, anchor, cigarette, symbol, cash: increase the corresponding stat
- bible, textbook, dictionary: delusion-based rotating barrier items
- crop top: cigarettes and a bit of mucus, your avatar wears it (it says 'slut' in big pink letters)
- suit: shark and a bit of delusion, likewise (you can wear both at once)
- knife: weapon, do damage on impact that's the average of your cigarettes and shark
- tooth: mucus-based weapon
- rocket: homing weapon
- laser: high-power activated weapon
- tear: slow healing
- sleeping pills: activated shield, mucus-based
- ???: shoot sideways

character-specific equipment drops
natalia:
- natalia's heart: a heart with a hole in that triples how long you're invincible after being hit
- natalia's chains: broken chains attached to your wrists that slash across the screen when you recover from a hit, charged by how much you've been hit for including while invincible
[god]:
- determinist loup: see attacks telegraphed before they happen, by an amount of time based on god
- four-dimensional flower: activated item to phase through things
